GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on software development projects. Here are some key points about GitHub:

Version Control: GitHub is built around Git, a distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes in their codebase, manage different versions, and collaborate with others seamlessly.

Repositories: Projects on GitHub are stored in repositories. Each repository contains all the files and folders associated with a project, along with the revision history.
